## Project Brief

The objective of this project was to create a solution for users of the Canberra Ultimate frisbee website, so that they could access relevant information easily, effectively and in a short amount of time.


## User Testing

The project began with a round of user surveys to determine the kinds of tasks that Frisbee Players use the website to complete and what the pain points are for achieving these tasks. Based on these users, a new Information architecture was drafted to be used in a round of Treejack testing. After a round of Treejack testing with the new IA, it became clear the the site contained more content than the average user was looking for and to best meet the brief, I decided to switch direction and develop an app which would incorporated all the features of the website that are used weekly into one convenient program for users.

This image floats to the left of this paragraph and is 250px wide. Its aspect ratio is maintained so it will not stretch. The picture shows the New York skyline. You can see how the design is responsive and how the cards intelligently fit to the display. With flexbox and css grid, heavy frameworks such as bootstrap aren't necessary to create beautiful responsive designs. The cards in aether use flexbox to change the image from the right side on desktops to the top on mobile.
