## My name is Claire and I am an Interaction Design student

I am currently studying a Bachelor of Interaction Design at the University of Canberra. I tried a few different things before landing in this field, but I know I am in the right place now. Creating things that are just visually appealing but are functional and practical, and in the exceptional cases life-changing. Good design has so much potential to shape our world, and that makes designers people who push boundaries and improve the lives of those around them.

I particularly love the concept of Ubiquitous Computing, after writing a report on it during my degree, I realised how much I agreed with the core ideals of this way of thinking. The goal of technology and design, should not be to suck us in and take us out of our lives, it should work in the background and all around us, improving things in the background. When technology and design is done well, you see vast improvements, but barely even notice what is producing them.\
